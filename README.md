With this extension you can add or modify template events, css & language strings.

All template events are already in the extension. All ACP template events are also present.

It is also possible to add custom language strings. These will replace the standard phpBB language strings.

This extension will only be updated when new phpBB events are added in the standard phpBB software.

I use it on my live forum, and everything works perfectly!
